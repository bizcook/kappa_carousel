#Kappa Karousel

You first task is to make an AJAX call from the client side app.js, using the .ajax method, which will be set to GET, and access the '/data' url. When successful, it should bring the data back down. You will then need to combine that with what you learned today about making a carousel.

What I would like to see on the DOM, is one person represented. A series of 22 (or the number of people in the cohort) index points with the first person's index highlighted or called out in style differently than the others. Also on the DOM should be a 'next' and 'prev' button. Clicking on the next button should navigate to the next person, clicking on the prev button should navigate to the previous person. The highlighted index point should update also as you click next and prev.

When a person is displayed, show their name, their city, and their piece of shoutout feedback. Only one person should be show cased at any given time.

You will need to combine everything you learned this week to accomplish this task, and each of the challenges you have completed this week play a part in this task.
